        <h1><span class="emoji">🎮</span> Mavera Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">👋</span> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mavera ("we", "our", or "us") is a word puzzle game designed for children and families. This Privacy
            Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>🔒 Our Commitment:</strong> Mavera is designed with children's privacy in mind. We minimize data
            collection and provide easy data deletion options.
        </div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">📊</span> Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (name, email, address, phone number)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Photos, media, or files</li>
            <li>Device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Game data stored in the cloud (Unity Gaming Services):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game progress and high scores</li>
            <li>Leaderboard rankings (anonymous player ID)</li>
            <li>Avatar preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is associated with an anonymous player ID and does not contain personally identifiable information.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Game data stored locally on your device:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language preferences</li>
            <li>Sound settings</li>
            <li>Cached game progress</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="emoji">🏆</span> Leaderboard Details</h3>
        <p><strong>Anonymous Player ID:</strong> When you first play Mavera, Unity Authentication automatically creates
            a random, anonymous Player ID (e.g., "abc123xyz"). This ID is not linked to your name, email, or any
            personal information. It is used solely to track your game progress across sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>Username/Nickname:</strong> You can optionally choose a display name (nickname) that appears on the
            leaderboard. This name is chosen by you and should not contain personal information. If you don't choose a
            name, a randomly generated name will be displayed.</p>
        <p><strong>Avatar Selection:</strong> You can select an avatar icon from predefined options. These avatars are
            provided by the app and do not involve uploading personal photos.</p>
        <p><strong>Leaderboard Privacy:</strong> Your score is automatically submitted to the global leaderboard when
            you complete puzzles. Currently, there is no option to hide from the leaderboard while keeping your progress
            synced. If you wish to be removed from the leaderboard, use the "Delete My Data" feature, which will reset
            your score to zero and mark your entry as deleted.</p>

        <h3><span class="emoji">📝</span> App Permissions</h3>
        <p>To function properly, Mavera requires the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Used solely to display ads via Google AdMob.</li>
            <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Used to check if the device is connected to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are used exclusively for advertising purposes and not for collecting personal data.</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">📺</span> Advertising</h2>
        <p>Mavera displays advertisements through Google AdMob. Our advertising is configured for child-directed
            content in compliance with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>COPPA</strong> (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)</li>
            <li><strong>Google's Families Policy</strong></li>
            <li><strong>GDPR</strong> (General Data Protection Regulation) for users under age of consent</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="emoji">🛡️</span> Child Safety Ad Configuration</h3>
        <p>Our app implements the following technical safeguards in the ad SDK:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TagForChildDirectedTreatment:</strong> Enabled - ensures COPPA-compliant ads</li>
            <li><strong>MaxAdContentRating:</strong> Set to "G" (General Audiences) - only family-friendly ads are shown
            </li>
            <li><strong>TagForUnderAgeOfConsent:</strong> Enabled - provides additional protection for users under GDPR
                age of consent</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="emoji">📋</span> Types of Advertisements</h3>
        <p>Mavera uses the following ad formats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interstitial Ads:</strong> Full-screen ads shown after completing every 5 categories. These ads
                appear only after the game displays a clear warning message ("Ad loading...") for 3 seconds, ensuring
                the user expects the ad.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewarded Ads:</strong> Optional ads that users can choose to watch in exchange for hints during
                gameplay. These are never shown automatically.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>🔔 Ad Warning System:</strong> Before any interstitial ad is displayed, users see a clear message
            ("Congratulations! Ad loading...") for 3 seconds. This ensures children are not surprised by ads and
            prevents accidental clicks, in compliance with Google Play's Families Policy.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> AdMob may collect certain device information (such as advertising ID) to serve
            appropriate ads. This data is handled by Google according to their <a
                href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We have enabled
            "child-directed treatment" in AdMob to ensure appropriate ad content.
        </div>

        <h3><span class="emoji">🎯</span> Ad Personalization & Control</h3>
        <p>Since our app is configured for child-directed content, personalized advertising is disabled. To reset your
            Advertising ID:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Reset advertising ID</li>
            <!-- <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising → Reset Identifier</li> -->
        </ul>

        <h2><span class="emoji">👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</span> Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Mavera is designed for users of all ages, including children under 13. We comply with COPPA by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not collecting personal information from children</li>
            <li>Using child-directed ad settings</li>
            <li>Not enabling behavioral advertising</li>
            <li>Not including social features or user-generated content</li>
            <li>Not requiring user accounts or registration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="emoji">👨‍👩‍👧</span> Parental Controls & Age Verification</h3>
        <p><strong>Age Verification:</strong> Mavera does not implement age verification or age gates. Since no personal
            information is collected and ads are child-safe by default, explicit age verification is not required.</p>
        <p><strong>Parental Consent:</strong> Because we do not collect personally identifiable information from any
            user
            (including children), verifiable parental consent is not required under COPPA. However, parents or guardians
            can use the "Delete My Data" feature at any time to remove their child's anonymous game progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Parental Supervision:</strong> We encourage parents to supervise their children's app usage. The game
            contains no in-app purchases, no social features, and no external links to websites.</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🔐</span> Data Security</h2>
        <p>Your game data is transmitted securely to Unity Gaming Services using industry-standard encryption
            (HTTPS/TLS).
            While we do not collect personally identifiable information, your anonymous game progress and scores are
            stored on Unity's secure servers. Local preferences are stored on your device.</p>

        <p><strong>Unity Analytics:</strong> We have disabled Unity Analytics in our application. No gameplay behavior,
            session duration, or user interaction data is collected or transmitted.</p>

        <h3><span class="emoji">🗑️</span> Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>You have multiple options to delete your data:</p>

        <p><strong>Option 1: In-App Deletion (Recommended)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the app → Settings → "Delete My Data" button</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Option 2: Email Request</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you cannot access the app (e.g., lost device), you can request data deletion by emailing us at
                <a href="mailto:mavera.support@proton.me">mavera.support@proton.me</a> with the subject "Data Deletion
                Request".
            </li>
            <li>Please include your <strong>Player ID</strong> (found at the bottom of the Settings menu in the app)
                so we can locate your anonymous data. Without this ID, we cannot identify your data to delete it.</li>
            <li>We will process your request within 30 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Data deletion will permanently remove:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All cloud-stored game progress and scores</li>
            <li>Avatar and settings preferences</li>
            <li>All locally cached data</li>
            <li>Your Unity Authentication account</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Leaderboard Entries:</strong> When you delete your account, your leaderboard score is reset to zero
            and marked as deleted. The entry may remain visible in the leaderboard but is no longer linked to any
            identifiable user account. This ensures complete anonymization of your previous rankings.
        </div>

        <p>After deletion, you will be signed out and can start fresh if desired.</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🌍</span> Third-Party Services</h2>
